Hi! I'm a fourth year PhD student in Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work in the Recommender Systems Lab under Robin Burke.

My research interests revolve around fairness in machine learning. My work has focused specifically on improving fairness in recommender systems when fairness is multi-dimensional with multiple definitions.

My current focus is on the SCRUF-D project. SCRUF-D is a framework for improving fairness in recommender systems using social choice, allowing for flexibility to represent multiple fairness concerns with multiple definitions of fairness.
