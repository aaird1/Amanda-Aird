<p>Hi! I'm a fourth year PhD student in Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work in the Recommender Systems Lab under Robin Burke.</p>

<p>My research interests revolve around fairness in machine learning. My work has focused specifically on improving fairness in recommender systems when fairness is multi-dimensional with multiple definitions.</p>

<p>My current focus is on the SCRUF-D project. SCRUF-D is a framework for improving fairness in recommender systems using social choice, allowing for flexibility to represent multiple fairness concerns with multiple definitions of fairness.</p>
